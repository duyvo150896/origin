	1. Weak and strength:
		a. Weak
			- I think my biggest weakness that I hard to say no to people. Especially, when the manager assign task to me, I always say yes although some time I have no work load more for that. It causes I often work in additional hour to complete it.
			- Although some time It makes me stressful a little bit, but It is also the chance for me to show up my capabilities.
		b. Strength
			- I am a fast leaner, excellent problem-solving capabilities, and I can manage a significant work load, careful in daily working.
			- I am good at teamwork, communication.
			- Also, I am able to handle multiple task and work independently also. For example, now I am contact person for Linux platform between our team and customer on Japanese, I discuss and work directly with them with rarely get support from the manager.
			- And I see that I have talent to training for fresh engineer also. 2 my current mentee is working very well and on going to become the key member of team like me now.
			- Have good mind-set in quality of product in development process.
